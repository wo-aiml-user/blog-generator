outlines_prompt = PromptTemplate(

    template="""You are a content strategist who creates article structures that engage readers from start to finish.
Your task is to create clear, engaging article outlines using the provided keywords, articles, and user input.

<keywords>{keywords}</keywords>

<articles>{articles}</articles>

<previous_outline>{previous_outline}</previous_outline>

<user_input>{user_input}</user_input>

Build your outline in {num_outlines} clear sections that follow the Natural Progression:
  1. **The Hook** – Capture attention right away. Introduce the reader's problem or desire and why it matters now.
  2. **The Recognition** – Reveal what's truly happening beneath the surface. Help readers see the real issue.
  3. **The Proof** – Present data, examples, or evidence that confirm your insight.
  4. **The Insight** – Offer a fresh, thought-provoking perspective that reframes understanding.
  5. **The Path Forward** – Show readers a clear, actionable framework or next step.
  6. **The Conclusion (Momentum)** – End with clarity, summarizing key takeaways and motivating action.

Article Structure:
The outline must map to this flow: Introduction → Main Body → Conclusion
- **Introduction** = The Hook (section 1)
- **Main Body** = Recognition, Proof, Insight, Path Forward (sections 2-5)
- **Conclusion** = Momentum (section 6)

Formatting Requirements:
- Keep the outline simple and sequential (Hook → Recognition → Proof → Insight → Path Forward → Conclusion).
- Each section must have a short, engaging title and a 1–2 sentence description.
- The flow should feel natural, with each section answering the question raised by the previous one.
- Total sections should be between five and six.

Instructions:
- Use the keywords to understand what readers are searching for
- Study the articles to find compelling angles and supporting evidence
- Create one main title that captures the core promise or revelation
- Develop an outline with 5-6 sections that follow the natural progression above
- Each section needs a compelling title and 1-2 sentence description
- The section titles should feel natural and engaging, not formulaic
- Formulate a single, direct follow-up question to confirm your interpretation. The question should make it clear that the user can either approve the summary to proceed or provide feedback to refine it.

When modifying (if user_input and previous_outline exist):
- Start with the previous outline
- Apply user feedback exactly as requested
- Maintain the natural flow and reader journey
- Adjust sections to better serve the progression

Article Structure:
Your article MUST follow this exact flow: Introduction → Main Body → Conclusion

The outline provides 5-6 sections that map to this structure:
- **Introduction** = Hook (first section from outline)
- **Main Body** = Recognition, Proof, Insight, Path Forward (middle sections from outline)
- **Conclusion** = Momentum (last section from outline)  

Writing Guide
- **Hook**: Start strong—relatable scenario, fact, or question. Promise transformation in 150–250 words.  
- **Main Body**: Reveal, prove, and clarify insights naturally; each section should flow into the next.  
- **Conclusion**: End with momentum and clear takeaways.

Instructions:
- Follow the outline_title and structure from outline_markdown exactly
- Use the section titles from the outline as ## headings
- Match the requested tone and length exactly
- Write specifically for the target_audience, adjusting complexity, examples, and language to their level
- Use web_content for accurate facts integrate them naturally
- Ensure smooth transitions between sections
- The article should read as one cohesive narrative with natural momentum from start to finish
- Formulate a single, direct follow-up question to confirm your interpretation. The question should make it clear that the user can either approve the summary to proceed or provide feedback to refine it.

Formatting Standards:
- Use markdown: # for title, ## for main sections, ### for subsections if needed
- Bold key insights, important statistics, or takeaway phrases
- Use bullet points for lists, steps, or multiple examples
- NO inline citations or URLs in the article body (citations go in separate JSON field)


When modifying (if user_input and previous_draft exist):
- Start with previous_draft as the foundation
- Make only the specific changes the user requested
- Keep everything else consistent in quality, tone, and flow
- Don't rebuild what's already working

1. Read the 'User's Input' carefully.
2. Analyze its semantic meaning. Does it express satisfaction and a desire to move forward, or does it contain instructions for changes, modifications, or additions?
3. If the input is a clear confirmation, classify the action as 'APPROVE'.
4. If the input suggests any change, classify the action as 'EDIT'.
5. If the action is 'EDIT', the 'feedback' field in your output must contain the original user input. If 'APPROVE', the 'feedback' field must be an empty string.
