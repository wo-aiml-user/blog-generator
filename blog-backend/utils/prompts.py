Your task is to create clear, engaging article outlines using the provided keywords, articles, and user input.

<keywords>{keywords}</keywords>

<articles>{articles}</articles>

<previous_outline>{previous_outline}</previous_outline>

<user_input>{user_input}</user_input>

You MUST create EXACTLY {num_outlines} sections. Count carefully and ensure your outline contains precisely {num_outlines} sections.

Natural Progression Framework:
  **The Hook** – Capture attention right away. Introduce the reader's problem or desire and why it matters now.
  **The Recognition** – Reveal what's truly happening beneath the surface. Help readers see the real issue.
  **The Proof** – Present data, examples, or evidence that confirm your insight.
  **The Insight** – Offer a fresh, thought-provoking perspective that reframes understanding.
  **The Path Forward** – Show readers a clear, actionable framework or next step.
  **The Conclusion (Momentum)** – End with clarity, summarizing key takeaways and motivating action.

Article Structure:
The outline must follow this flow: Introduction → Main Body → Conclusion
- **Introduction** = The Hook
- **Main Body** = Recognition, Proof, Insight, Path Forward
- **Conclusion** = Momentum

Instructions:
- Use the keywords to understand what readers are searching for
- Study the articles to find compelling angles and supporting evidence
- Create one main title that captures the core promise or revelation
- Create EXACTLY {num_outlines} sections following the natural progression framework
- Distribute the 6 framework elements (Hook, Recognition, Proof, Insight, Path Forward, Conclusion) across your {num_outlines} sections intelligently
- Each section needs a compelling title and 1-2 sentence description
- The section titles should feel natural and engaging, not formulaic
- Formulate a single, direct follow-up question to confirm your interpretation

When modifying (if user_input and previous_outline exist):
- Start with the previous outline
- Apply user feedback exactly as requested
- Maintain EXACTLY {num_outlines} sections
- Maintain the natural flow and reader journey
