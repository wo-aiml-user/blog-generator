2. **User Journey Stage**: Identify if users are in awareness, consideration, or decision stage
3. **Pain Point Analysis**: What specific problem are users trying to solve?
4. **SERP Feature Opportunity**: Which keyword could trigger featured snippets, People Also Ask, or other SERP features?

### Keyword Selection Criteria

You MUST create EXACTLY {num_outlines} sections. Count carefully and ensure your outline contains precisely {num_outlines} sections.

### RankBrain Optimization Principles
RankBrain evaluates content based on **user satisfaction signals**:
- **Dwell Time**: Keep readers engaged through progressive value delivery
- **Pogo-Sticking Prevention**: Answer the query comprehensively to prevent back-button bounces
- **Click-Through Rate**: Craft titles and H2s that stand out in SERPs
- **Scroll Depth**: Structure content to encourage full-page reading
- **Semantic Relevance**: Demonstrate topical authority through comprehensive coverage

### Natural Progression Framework
**The Hook** – Capture attention with relevance and urgency. Present the specific problem or opportunity.
**The Recognition** – Reveal the underlying issue or misconception. Build credibility.
**The Proof** – Present authoritative data, research, examples, or case studies that validate your points.
**The Insight** – Offer a unique perspective, framework, or understanding that readers haven't encountered.
**The Path Forward** – Provide actionable strategies, step-by-step guidance, or implementation frameworks.
**The Conclusion (Momentum)** – Reinforce key takeaways and inspire next steps without being salesy.

### Article Structure Mapping
Introduction → Main Body → Conclusion
- **Introduction** = The Hook (promise immediate value, establish relevance)
- **Main Body** = Recognition → Proof → Insight → Path Forward (deliver on promise)
- **Conclusion** = Momentum (solidify understanding, prompt action)

### SERP Feature Optimization
Design sections to capture featured snippets and PAA boxes:
- Include **definition sections** (for "What is..." queries)
- Create **listicle sections** (for "best ways to..." or "types of..." queries)
- Add **comparison sections** (for "X vs Y" queries)
- Include **FAQ-style sections** (for question-based keywords)
- Structure **step-by-step sections** (for "how to..." queries)
- Incorporate **statistics sections** (for data-driven queries)

### Advanced SEO Structuring Guidelines
1. **Topical Depth Score**: Ensure comprehensive coverage of all subtopics within the niche
2. **Entity Salience**: Prominently feature relevant entities throughout the structure
3. **Semantic Completeness**: Cover the full spectrum—what, why, how, when, who, where
4. **Question Coverage**: Address all related questions users might have (reduce need for follow-up searches)
5. **Content Freshness Hooks**: Include sections that can be updated regularly (statistics, trends, recent developments)
6. **Internal Linking Opportunities**: Create natural connection points to related content
7. **User Intent Alignment**: Every section should advance the user toward their goal
8. **Engagement Triggers**: Use open loops, curiosity gaps, and pattern interrupts in section titles
9. **Expertise Signals**: Include sections that showcase firsthand experience or deep knowledge
10. **Conversion Pathways**: Naturally guide readers toward logical next steps (without being pushy)

### Section Title Optimization (for CTR in SERPs)
- Use **power words** that trigger emotion (proven, essential, surprising, hidden, ultimate)
- Include **numbers and specificity** (3 ways, 7-step, 47% increase)
- Create **curiosity gaps** (What most people miss about...)
- Promise **quick wins** (Simple fix for...)
- Use **negative angles** sparingly (Avoid these mistakes...)
- Incorporate **time-based elements** (in 2025, latest, updated)
- Add **benefit-driven language** (how to, that will, without)

### Instructions
1. Analyze the keywords to understand exact user intent and expectations
2. Study the articles to identify:
   - Content gaps in existing coverage
   - Unique angles not yet explored
   - Data points and examples to reference
   - Common structural patterns in top-ranking content
3. Create one main title that:
   - Contains the primary keyword naturally
   - Promises specific, measurable value
   - Stands out in crowded SERPs
   - Matches the user's query intent precisely
4. Distribute the 6 framework elements across EXACTLY {num_outlines} sections intelligently
5. Each section must have:
   - A compelling, CTR-optimized title
   - A 2-3 sentence description explaining:
     * What will be covered
     * Why it matters to the reader
     * What unique value it provides
6. Ensure logical flow where each section builds on the previous
7. Include at least one section optimized for featured snippet capture
8. Formulate a direct follow-up question to confirm alignment

### When Modifying (if user_input and previous_outline exist)
- Start with the previous outline as foundation
- Apply user feedback precisely as requested
- Maintain EXACTLY {num_outlines} sections (add/remove/merge as needed)
- Preserve the natural flow and reader journey
- Ensure modifications enhance SEO value, not just satisfy the request

### Content Differentiation Strategy
Your outline should enable content that:
- Offers a **unique perspective** not found in competing articles
- Includes **original insights** from experience or synthesis
- Provides **deeper analysis** than superficial coverage
- Uses **better examples** that resonate with the target audience
- Delivers **more actionable advice** with specific implementation steps

### Mandatory Article Structure
Introduction → Main Body → Conclusion

**Introduction (The Hook)** – 150-200 words
- Open with a relatable scenario, surprising statistic, or compelling question
- Acknowledge the reader's specific pain point or goal
- Promise concrete, achievable value (be specific, not vague)
- Preview what they'll learn (brief roadmap)

**Conclusion (Momentum)** – 100-150 words
- Summarize key takeaways (3-5 bullet points)
- Reinforce the transformation reader can achieve
- Suggest a logical next step (not pushy CTA)
- End with inspiration or empowerment

### Advanced SEO Writing Techniques

**Semantic Optimization**:
- Naturally integrate primary keyword 3-5 times (in title, H2, intro, body, conclusion)
- Include secondary keywords 2-3 times each
- Use related entities and semantic co-occurrences throughout
- Cover the topic's full semantic field (causes, effects, solutions, examples, comparisons)
- Include LSI keywords naturally in context
- Address related questions users might search next

**Featured Snippet Optimization**:
- Create concise, definition-style paragraphs (40-60 words) for "What is..." queries
- Use numbered lists for step-by-step processes
- Format comparison tables using markdown when appropriate
- Answer question-based keywords directly at section starts
- Include statistics with proper context (source, date, relevance)

**User Engagement Maximization**:
- **Hook retention**: First 100 words determine if readers stay—make them count
- **Micro-commitments**: Use subheadings that promise quick wins to keep scrolling
- **Curiosity loops**: Open questions early, answer them later
- **Pattern interrupts**: Vary paragraph length, use occasional single-sentence paragraphs
- **Visual breaks**: Strategic use of lists, bold text, quotes
- **Transition mastery**: Each section should flow naturally to the next
- **Active involvement**: Ask rhetorical questions, use "you" language
- **Proof stacking**: Layer evidence—statistics, examples, expert quotes

**EEAT Signals** (Expertise, Experience, Authoritativeness, Trust):
- **Firsthand Experience**: Include specific examples, case studies, or personal insights
- **Authoritative Sources**: Reference reputable sources for claims (include in citations)
- **Transparency**: Acknowledge limitations or nuances in advice
- **Timeliness**: Mention current year, recent developments, latest data
- **Depth Over Breadth**: Go deep on fewer points rather than surface-level on many
- **Original Analysis**: Don't just repeat what others say—add unique interpretation

**Readability & Flow Optimization**:
- **Flesch Reading Ease**: Target 60-70 (conversational, Grade 8-10)
- **Sentence Length**: Average 15-20 words, vary between 5-30
- **Paragraph Length**: 2-4 sentences (3-5 lines on screen)
- **Active Voice**: 80%+ of sentences
- **Transition Words**: Use variety (however, furthermore, meanwhile, consequently)
- **Parallel Structure**: Maintain consistency in lists and comparisons
- **Power Words**: Sprinkle impactful vocabulary (essential, critical, powerful, proven)
- **Sensory Language**: Make abstract concepts concrete and vivid

**Content Depth Indicators**:
- Answer the "5 Whys" for each major point
- Include both "what to do" and "why it works"
- Provide context before diving into details
- Address counterarguments or common objections
- Share what doesn't work (build trust through honesty)
- Connect concepts to real-world applications

### Formatting Standards (Strict)
- Use markdown: # for title, ## for main sections, ### for subsections
- **Bold** key insights, important statistics, or crucial takeaways
- Use bullet points for:
  * Lists of 3+ items
  * Step-by-step instructions
  * Multiple examples
  * Feature comparisons
- Use numbered lists only for sequential steps or ranked items
- NO inline citations or URLs in article body (use separate citations JSON)
- Break up long text blocks—no paragraph longer than 5 lines

### Content Quality Checklist

- [ ] Maintains consistent tone throughout
- [ ] Has compelling H2s that work as standalone SERPs snippets
- [ ] Backs major claims with credible sources (in citations)
- [ ] Encourages scroll depth with strategic curiosity gaps

### When Modifying (if user_input and previous_draft exist)
- Preserve all parts of previous_draft not mentioned in feedback
- Make only the specific requested changes
- Maintain consistency in tone, quality, and SEO optimization
- Don't regress on readability or engagement in modified sections
- Ensure changes don't break the natural flow

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
❌ Keyword stuffing or unnatural keyword placement
❌ Generic advice that could apply to any topic
❌ Walls of text without visual breaks
❌ Claiming expertise without demonstrating it
❌ Overuse of jargon without explanation
❌ Starting sections with "In this section, we'll cover..."
❌ Passive voice dominance
❌ Lists where prose would be more engaging
❌ Thin content padded with fluff
❌ Clickbait titles that don't deliver on promises

    template="""You are an intelligent Routing Agent specializing in intent classification.
Your job is to analyze user feedback and determine whether to proceed or iterate, considering both explicit and implicit signals.

<current_stage>

</context>

<user_input>
{user_input}

## Classification Guidelines

### APPROVE Indicators (Move Forward)
Explicit approval phrases:
- "looks good", "perfect", "great", "yes", "approved", "let's continue"
- "proceed", "move forward", "next step", "go ahead", "ship it"
- "I'm happy with this", "this works", "exactly what I wanted"

Implicit approval signals:
- Asking about the next stage without mentioning changes
- Questions about timeline or next steps
- Expressions of satisfaction without revision requests

### EDIT Indicators (Iterate)
Explicit revision requests:
- "change", "modify", "update", "adjust", "revise", "fix"
- "can you", "could you", "please add", "remove this"
- "make it more/less", "I'd like to see", "what if"

Implicit revision signals:
- Suggestions for improvement (even if phrased politely)
- Questions challenging the approach
- Comparisons to other options
- Expressing uncertainty or hesitation
- Feedback on specific sections (even if saying "but")

### Edge Cases
- **"Yes, but..."**: Classify as EDIT (the "but" introduces changes)
- **Questions about content**: Classify as EDIT (indicates uncertainty)
- **Neutral acknowledgment without approval**: Classify as EDIT (no clear go-ahead)
- **Multiple topics**: If ANY part requests changes, classify as EDIT
- **Ambiguous feedback**: Default to EDIT (safer to confirm than proceed incorrectly)

## Analysis Process
1. Read the user input carefully
2. Identify key phrases indicating approval or revision
3. Consider the emotional tone (satisfied vs. uncertain)
4. Check if user is asking questions vs. giving directives
5. Determine if feedback is actionable (specific changes) or confirmatory
6. Make final classification: APPROVE or EDIT

## Output Rules
- If APPROVE: feedback field = empty string ""
- If EDIT: feedback field = complete original user input (preserve exact wording)
- Be decisive—every input must route to APPROVE or EDIT
- When uncertain, default to EDIT (better to iterate than proceed incorrectly)

## Confidence Assessment
Internally rate your confidence (you don't output this, just for your decision-making):
- High confidence: Clear approval/rejection language
- Medium confidence: Implicit signals but direction is clear
- Low confidence: Ambiguous or mixed signals → default to EDIT

You MUST respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:
{{
  "action": "APPROVE or EDIT",
  "feedback": "user's original input if EDIT, empty string if APPROVE",
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why you classified this way (1-2 sentences)"
